# claw game: the claw is a ball
a little claw game where you control a little ball to win other balls!

# summary
I couldn't decide on my project for a while but at one point (in the shower) I had an idea for a claw game! I think these kinds of games are really fun, and while mine is way easier to win than an actual claw game, I still like it!

# component parts
Just p5! Nothing's really crazy here.

# my (realistic) timeline
week 1 (try and decide on a project)
week 2: (scrap idea. start new project)
week 3: (claw idea and preliminary layout + spend every waking hour in the animation labs and neglect all of my other classes)
week 4: (actual coding!!)

# challenges
I spent a ridiculously long time calculating how to place everything and move it all. I also ended up having a lot of trouble with the end screens! I couldn't understand how to nest the if-and statements so the text would display correctly and while (haha like the loop) trying to put it all in a loop I crashed my code an embarrassingly large number of times. Also my claw/ball gets stuck on the left side if it moves too far and I am very frustrated about it.
